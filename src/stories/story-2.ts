        description: "Welcome to the Late Devonian. At this point in time, insects and some of the first seed-bearing plants have spread across land, and the continents are starting to drift toward forming a supercontinent called Pangaea. Millions of years have passed since our last stop on this time tour, and yet the continents look very different to back then. Do you remember the name of the movement of the continents we discussed back in our last stop of this walk through time?",

        title: "Possible Causes",
        description: "Scientists think a combination of different factors could have contributed to this extinction. One theory is that as large land plants spread, they changed the environment by increasing soil erosion and nutrient runoff into the oceans. This may have triggered huge algae growth in the water, which then used up most of the oxygen, leaving too little for other organisms. Other possible causes include sudden climate changes (both warmer and colder temperatures), volcanic eruptions, and even impacts from asteroids.",

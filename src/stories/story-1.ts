        description: `The continents look very different, don’t you think? This is due to Continental Drift, the slow movement of continents, comparable to the speed at which your fingernails grow. Over millions of years, this movement changed the global landscape and redistributed resources, but it also led to swings in sea levels, which affected oxygen levels and nutrients, disrupting marine ecosystems.`,

        description: `Life also had to deal with changes in the climate, like you currently do, but they had to endure sudden global cooling. This could’ve been because of the increased amount of plant life consuming enough CO2 that the atmosphere could no longer retain as much heat from the sun. As with sudden global warming, life wasn’t ready for rapid cooling around it.`,

        description: `These changes in the climate and the ecosystems were too much sudden pressure for life in the Ordovician. It wasn’t overnight, but these processes built up over millions of years, causing many species to be unable to adapt in time. This was the first mass extinction of the Big Five extinctions in the geologic record. It is estimated that more than 80% of marine life went extinct after this, including many of these creatures.`,
